### This script produces the plots for the hospital-related sections of the BHF's Socioeconomic Health Inequalities in Scotland report
### Data is sourced from a number of sources, including: NHS Scotland, National Records of Scotland, the Scottish Health Survey, and Scottish Government. Full details available in associated report.
### Note: some manual cleaning in Excel was done, and these files are used for the script.
### These files are: 
#outpatients-by-nhs-board-of-residence-and-simd-to-december-2022-new
#HB_population_by_simd.xlsx
#inpatient_data.xlsx

### Code structure (after loading necessary packages)
### Section 1 creates the custom BHF style functions for the plots (this requires access to our custom fonts)
### Section 2 sets the working directory (this will need amending to run locally if you're using the code)
### Section 3 reads, cleans, and analyses the data.
### 3.1 Outpatient
### 3.2 Inpatient
### 3.3 Day cases
