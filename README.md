# Scotland_health_inequalities

The scripts and associated data in this repository produce the plots used in the BHF's Socioeconomic Health Inequalities in Scotland Report.

There are five scripts:<br />
-> Scotland_Prevention Script:<br />
----> This produces the plots on CVD risk factors (Figures 2-5), on smoking, BMI, physical activity, and fruit & veg consumption <br />
-> Scotland_Outcomes_Script:<br /> 
----> This produces the plots on CVD morbidity and mortality, and other outcomes (life and healthy life expectancy) (Figures 6-7, 11-14, 28-30)
-> GP and Waiting List script: <br />
----> This produces the plots on primary care (GPs), and the cardiology-specific waiting list plots from the Appendix (Figures 8-9, 15-16, 26-27) <br />
-> Scotland_hospital_data_script<br />
----> This produces the Appendix plots on hospital episodes (inpatient, outpatient, and day case) for non-cardiology specific care (Figures 17-25)
